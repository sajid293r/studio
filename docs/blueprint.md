# **App Name**: GuestID Validator

## Core Features:

- Guest ID Upload: Allow guests to upload images or PDFs of their IDs through a secure interface.
- Inline Verification Tool: Enable administrators to view uploaded IDs and approve or reject them, using reasoning to identify problems and decide when the images or PDFs provided by guests meet requirements for approval. Focus on clearly presenting the most salient points.
- Bulk ID Download: Provide functionality for administrators to download guest IDs in bulk for compliance or auditing purposes.
- Automatic Data Deletion: Implement an automatic deletion policy that removes all guest ID data 60 days after their recorded check-out date.
- Check-in / Check-out Date Recording: Store the check-in / check-out date of each user, to be used in automatic data deletion
